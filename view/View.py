'''Method to redirect the users' requests to the required channel, after getting a message in the General channel.

This method is executed every time a message is received in the server. 
We use it only for the general channel, as the other channels have their methods.
First, it checks if the message was sent by the bot or in a different channel than general. If so, does nothing.
Else, it checks if the message starts with the mandatory command character, ignoring the message otherwise.
If the first character is a !, it checks the rest of the command. If it's an identified command, creates a private channel
and calls the method, displays help message otherwise.

Args: 
    message: The Message object containing the message sent by the user. Must be a discord.Message and cannot be None
Exceptions thrown:
    ValueError: if the message is None
